What domestic and external obstacles that may do damage to the relations between the two? Are there common grounds and potentials for the two to building alasting harmonious relation?
Given the growing economy, diversecultural legacies, and increasing influence of China and Indonesia,respectively representing the Chinese world and the Muslim world, the 5thZhenghe Forum will focus on China-Indonesia commonalities and connectivities asmanifested in history, religion, culture, economy, and societies, especially Zhenghe legacies.
